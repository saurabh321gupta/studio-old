# **App Name**: Endpoint Eye

## Core Features:

- Endpoint Listing: Display a configurable list of API endpoint titles (e.g., 'read-service-stage-east'), each with a button. Clicking the button triggers the API call.
- Status Indication: Display only the validation status (success/failure) with a clear green/red visual cue.
- Configuration Storage: Store configurations in a config file, such as the API endpoint to be called, its HTTP method, and its expected response.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) for a modern, tech-focused feel. A bright, saturated hue suggests energy and precision, fitting for an app that validates system operations.
- Background color: Dark navy (#191970) for a sleek and professional look. This desaturated, dark shade creates a comfortable contrast with the Electric Blue primary.
- Accent color: Hot Pink (#FF69B4) as an analogous color that gives contrast for indicating error states or calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and status types (success, failure).
- Use a clear, tabular layout to present endpoint data and validation results.
- Subtle animations when triggering endpoint validations and displaying results.
